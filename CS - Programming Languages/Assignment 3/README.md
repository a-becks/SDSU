This assignment has 3 programs:
1) Prog3_1.cpp: This is a C++ program that takes the name of a Lua file as a command line argument and executes that file in a lua environment.

2) Prog3_2.lua: This is a Lua function that takes a string expression in infix notation and returns a string expression in postfix notation.

3) Prog3_3.cpp: This is a C++ program that prompts the user for a string expression in infix notation.  It passes that string into a Lua environment and to the function created in prog3_2.  It then removes and prints the postfix expression from the lua stack.
